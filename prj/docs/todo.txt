- improve interface
	- when pressing the "CTRL+S" in the GDScript editor, it gets notified in the addon as well; investigate how to fix this
	- improve code for handle input: make separate functions for each case
	- change the "ItemsList" of the tables into something else; each table entrance should also have 2 buttons. Unfortunately "ItemsList" class can have only strings as children
		- delete table
		- edit table
	- improve the menu / top buttons
	- move "autosave on close" into a "properties" / "options" area
	- reimplement the layout so the dialog can be resized (at least maximized)

- improve "new DB" dialog:
	- handle DB name properly
		- check for special characters
		- implement unicode support
